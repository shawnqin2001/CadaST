# Similarity-Graph Based Spatial Context-Aware Denoising and Augmenting in Spatial Transcriptomics

## Discription

This project is a python implementation of **cadaST**, a spatial transcriptomics data denoising and augmenting method based on similarity graph. The method is proposed in the paper **Similarity-Graph Based Spatial Context-Aware Denoising and Augmenting in Spatial Transcriptomics**.
The method is implemented in the class `CadaST` in `model.py`.

## Installation
Use pip to install the package in your python environment.

```bash
conda create -n cadaST python=3.10
conda activate cadaST
pip install cadaST
```

To enable clustering method 'mclust', you shall install R package 'mclust'
```bash
pip install rpy2
Rscript -e "install.packages('mclust')"
```

## Usage
To get detailed tutorial, please refer to the [tutorial](tutorial).

### Parameters

- beta $\beta$: The scaling weight for the similarity graph.
- alpha $\alpha$: The scaling weight for correlation matrix.
- theta $\theta$: The decay value for non-matching labels in the label matrix.
- NPROCESS: The number of processes used for parallel computing.
